iFindArtist
===========

iFindArtist uses Flickr's API to explore and search photos using Stanford's Flickr Example expanded more

The aim of the project is to find budding artist trying to post their pictures publically and with Flickr APIs, I managed to get photographers of a particular location my doing a simple location search according to the latitude and longitude of the phone. 
 
Some additional features added from the first release is search, one can instantly search Flickr Database to find cool pictures according to text inputted in the search field. 
If he likes the photograph, one can just hold the photo until a share menu comes up to prompt him to email him the picture to save to his device or Airdrop to his/her friends.
 
The man feature added and still under development is the iBeacon feature. Trying to use Bluetooth as its channel, an Artist can broadcast his/her signal; with use of Bluetooth find other people trying to connect with you. 
 
The App was aimed to just enhance photographers to reach out and this will be kept on improving to provide better and more functionality.
